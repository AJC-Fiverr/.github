## 2. Description

This organization was created to group together course work from students of the courses I provide on the Fiverr platform. We use the features from Github to enhance the experience of the student in several ways. This platform provides the student a way space to write their code, share it with the tutor and get feedback on it. We can leverage **Pull Requests** for code reviews and the convenience of git history to track the code over time.

The topics of the courses are related to IaC technologies. The list of technologies I currently teach about is as follows:
